# DEPRECATED

The library was merged into [`purescript-prelude`](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-prelude).

The most recent [v3.0.0 release](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-symbols/releases/tag/v3.0.0) will continue to work for older libraries that still depend on it, although is incompatible with PureScript 0.12 and newer.
